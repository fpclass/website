    <p>The CS141 Perpetual Haskelling Initiative is an optional, collaborative Haskell programming project which will run in Week 4 of Term 3 (exact dates to be confirmed). By participating, we will:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Collaboratively develop a realistic software application in Haskell (and other languages, as required) and gain experience with Haskell programming, libraries, etc.</li>
        <li>Gain applied software engineering experience through the use of version control, code reviews, continuous integration, etc. in the same way as you would when working in the software industry.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you would like to participate in the discussion over what the exact project we will work on should be, <a href="https://github.com/fpclass/perpetual-haskelling-initiative/issues/1">feel free to join in</a>. Your thoughts or ideas would be most appreciated!</p>

    <h3>Slack</h3>

    <p>We have a <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/TAQRFMLSZ/C012G0HPGD8">Slack channel dedicated to the CS141 Perpetual Haskelling Initiative</a> on the CS141 Slack. This is the main place where we coordinate development, aside from discussion on GitHub, see below.</p>

    <h3>Version control</h3>
