<h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Solutions</h3>

<p>
    Model solutions are available for the CS141 lab exercises. These are intended for you to compare your own answers against, so you can see what other approaches are or what you could have done better. They are <strong></strong>not intended to be used in case you get stuck</strong>, because this prevents you from gaining the experience and skills that the labs are trying to teach you. The CS141 lab exercises are deliberately designed to test your understanding of the concepts taught in the module and may therefore be challenging if you have not yet understood the concept they are testing. Support is available from me (Michael) throughout the week if you are not getting anywhere after watching the relevant lectures and reading the relevant book chapters and additionally from TAs during the scheduled lab times. If you would like to compare your answers to the model solutions, please speak to me (Michael) to get access to them for exercises you have already completed.
